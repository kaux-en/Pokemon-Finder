Hellooo!
Welcome to my Pokemon Finder!
This is a Mini-Project that utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Async JavaScript and API interaction.
My Pokemon Finder has 4 pages; the Homepage, Search Pokemon page, Pokemon Details page, and the Pokemon Moves page.
These pages are represented by the HTML files that are respectively labeled, 'homepage.html', 'searchpokemon.html', 'pokemondetails.html', and 'pokemonmoves.html'.
There is CSS inline styling at work in the HTML files, but there also is an external CSS file labeled 'stylesheet.css'. This stylesheet is styling all HTML files.
Lastly, the interactivity that you'll experience is sourced from the JavaScript files entitled, 'pokemondetails.js', 'pokemonmoves.js', and 'searchpokemon.js'. These files are correlated with the HTML files of the same name.
The source of this API information is from PokeAPI.co.

I hope you enjoy this experience.
